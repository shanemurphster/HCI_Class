# High-Fidelity Registration — Prototype

This folder contains a phone-sized static HTML/CSS prototype for the registration app used in HCI class.

- Files:
  - `index.html` — static opening screen (phone-sized)
  - `styles.css` — styling for the prototype
  - `assets/path-at-penn.png` — UPenn logo used in the header

How to view locally

1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser (double-click).
2. Or start a simple local server (recommended):

   Python 3:

   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

   Then open `http://localhost:8000` and click `index.html`.

Notes

- This is a static mockup only; inputs and buttons are non-functional by design.
- The visual design uses the UPenn color palette and example course data.
